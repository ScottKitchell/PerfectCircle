# PerfectCircle
PerfectCircle is a social network designed to automatically match people with others that love the same stuff as they do.  
**It was initially developed in early 2015.**

## Demo
To see the site in action and make a few new friends go to [perfectcircle.social](http://www.perfectcircle.social).  
*Warning: Friends may never respond* :older_man: 

## Development
The PerfectCircle backend was developed using PHP. A MySQL database is used to store user data, friendship connections, posts, comments and likes.  
The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS and JQuery.

Matches or friendships are created using my own primitive version of machine learning... Having no idea about machine learning when developing this is quite evident and to be honest, I'm surprised matches are made at all. The algorithms forming them are by no means efficient and insufficient testing has been done to ensure their accuracy.
